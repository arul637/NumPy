## Installation of NumPy
*who using normal python interpreter, they wont have NumPy package, so we need to explicitly install the numpy*
             
    pip install numpy

<br>

`conda` environment it was preinstalled, but to update the package or some issue to reinstall the numpy package use this below command,

    conda install -c anaconda numpy

<br>

*`Anaconda Environment`* the packages like NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook are preinstalled, to install use the above *conda installation process*
